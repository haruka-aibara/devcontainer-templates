- WSL2 with Ubuntu installed
- Properly configured `.aws` and `.gitconfig` directories in your WSL2 Ubuntu home directory

### WSL2 Setup Prerequisites

Before using this DevContainer template, ensure:

1. WSL2 is installed and configured with Ubuntu
2. Your AWS credentials are set up in your WSL2 Ubuntu home directory:
   ```
   ~/.aws/credentials
   ~/.aws/config
   ```
3. Your Git configuration is set up in your WSL2 Ubuntu home directory:
   ```
   ~/.gitconfig
   ```

These files will be mounted into the container (read-only) to enable authentication with AWS services and maintain consistent Git commit identity.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Getting Started with the Template

This DevContainer template is published and ready to use directly through VS Code:

1. Open VS Code
2. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) 
3. Type and select: `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...`
4. Enter the URL of your repository or choose a repository from GitHub
5. When prompted for a container configuration, select "Custom definition..."
6. Enter the custom template ID:
   ```
   ghcr.io/haruka-aibara/devcontainer-templates/haruka-aibara-dev-env:latest
   ```
7. Follow the prompts to complete the setup
8. VS Code will create a container volume, clone your repository, and open it within the development container

## ðŸ›  Working with the Development Environment

Once your container is running, you'll have access to all the pre-configured tools:

After the container is running, all pre-configured tools are immediately available in the integrated terminal:

```bash
# Verify AWS CLI
aws --version

# Use Terraform (managed by tenv)
terraform --version

# Use Docker 
docker --version

# Use Python tools
python --version
uv --version
```

### AWS Credentials

AWS credentials from your host machine are automatically mounted (read-only) into the container. Verify with:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## ðŸ›  Customization

### Modifying the Dockerfile

Edit `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to add additional tools or customize the environment.

### Customizing VS Code Settings

Adjust `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to:
- Add/remove VS Code extensions
- Change editor preferences
- Modify container settings

### Post-Creation Script

The `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` script runs automatically after container creation. Modify it to:
- Install additional packages
- Configure environment variables
- Set up project-specific dependencies
